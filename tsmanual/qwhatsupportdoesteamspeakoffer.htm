<p class=kop-4>Q: What support does TeamSpeak offer?</p>
<p class=kop-4-p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=standaard>A: It depends if you are a commercial user or not. If you are a non-commercial user we offer support over our IRC channel (quakenet #teamspeak) and our forum (http://www.teamspeak.org/forum/ ).As a non-commercial user you CANNOT mail us for support! </p>
<p class=standaard>Since we have a enthousiastic crowd you can be pretty sure your questions will be answered in the forum or IRC channel.</p>
<p class=standaard>A word to the wise though: Especially in the IRC channel it is appreciated if you tried searching our forum first before you ask a question. From experience we can say that 95 % of all questions that are asked in IRC are already answered in the forum. Questions like: What port does TeamSpeak use? will most likely not be answered since it is stated in the F.A.Q., several answers in threads and in this manual.</p>
<p class=standaard>If your question is unique: Be sure that there will be enthousiastic people that are keen to solve your problem!</p>
<p class=standaard>Commercial users (and ONLY commercial users) can additionally use the mail for specific questions. Mail for commercial users: support@teamspeak.org. If you use this mail while being a non-commercial user: it will be ignored!</p>
